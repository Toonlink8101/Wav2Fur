- Pull raw audio data from a .wav file

- separate data into 60hz intervals

- make new array for blending process

- filter via hanning window

- FOR EACH SEGMENT:
    - find the loudest frequency
    - isolate that frequency
    - determine how loud it is
    - record the frequency and its loudness
    - filter out this frequency from the data
    - repeat steps a - e until the number of desired frequencies is met

- convert the gathered frequencies into notes and detunes
    

- convert loudness into values

- Options for output:
    - Plan A >> too complicated for now:
        - write gathered data to a .fur file

    - Plan B >> more work from user, but easier to implement:
        - output the data to the clipboard in chuncks of 256 rows

    - Plan C >> even more work (triple the work as B), but uses much less pattern data and allows for more track speeds:
        - output data as instrument macros and pattern data

- Profit

Ideas for further development:
- use Ext. channel 3 on its own
- use Ext. channel 3 in addition to the other 4-5 default channels
- use algorithm 7 and multiplier effects to have 4 sine waves per channel for non-extended channels
