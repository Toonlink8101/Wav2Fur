- Pull raw audio data from a .wav file
- separate data into 60hz intervals
- append each segment the segment following it
    Note: since the last segment does not have one following it, it will be excluded from the dataset
- blend each segment with a hanning window
- FOR EACH SEGMENT:
    - use (r)fft to find the loudest frequency
    - use a bandpass filter to isolate the loudest frequency
    - determine the loudness of this frequency
    - record the frequency and its loudness
    - use a notch filter to remove this frequency from the dataset 
    - repeat steps a - e until the number of desired frequencies is met
- convert the gathered frequencies into notes and cents
- convert the notes, cents, and loudness into something more usable as necessary

Plan B (more work from user, but easier to implement):
- output the data to the clipboard in chuncks of 256 rows
- Profit

Plan A (too complicated for now):
- write gathered data to a .fur file
- Profit
