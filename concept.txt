1. Pull raw audio data from a .wav file

2. separate data into 60hz intervals

3. append each segment the segment following it

    Note: since the last segment does not have one following it, it will be deleted before moving on

4. blend each segment with a hanning window

5. FOR EACH SEGMENT:

    a. use (r)fft to find the loudest frequency

    b. use a bandpass filter to isolate the loudest frequency

    c. determine the loudness of this frequency

    d. record the frequency and its loudness

    e. use a notch filter to remove this frequency from the dataset 

    f. repeat steps a - e until the number of desired frequencies is met

6. convert the gathered frequencies into notes and cents

7. convert the notes, cents, and loudness into something more usable as necessary

8. write gathered data to a .fur file

9. Profit
