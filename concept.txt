- Pull raw audio data from a .wav file

- separate data into 60hz intervals

- append each segment the segment following it

    Note: since the last segment does not have one following it, it will be deleted before moving on

- blend each segment with a hanning window

- FOR EACH SEGMENT:

    - use (r)fft to find the loudest frequency

    - use a bandpass filter to isolate the loudest frequency

    - determine the loudness of this frequency

    - record the frequency and its loudness

    - use a notch filter to remove this frequency from the dataset 

    - repeat steps a - e until the number of desired frequencies is met

- convert the gathered frequencies into notes and cents

- convert the notes, cents, and loudness into something more usable as necessary

- write gathered data to a .fur file

- Profit
